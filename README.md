- i am developing in slimv for the first time to see how it goes

    - so a.lisp looks more like a sketch book

##### lessons learned

- since syntax highlighting errors while in double quotes and behind ; i am putting less comments

- a.lisp gets cluttered and not ordered well because i can jump around and evaulate forms

- on days 1-6 i didn't work from the bottom up because i assumed the problems were small enough for me
  to do without getting too messy (i was wrong for most of the days)
